## GitHub CLI Workflow

Use these `gh` aliases to efficiently work with discussions:

**Find Questions to Answer:**
```bash
# List discussion categories for the repository
gh disc-categories owner repo

# Find unanswered questions in specific categories (Q&A, Help, etc.)
gh disc-category-discussions owner repo CATEGORY_ID unanswered

# Find all unanswered questions regardless of category
gh disc-category-discussions owner repo CATEGORY_ID any
```

**Prepare Your Response:**
```bash
# Read full discussion context including all comments and replies
gh disc-comments owner repo DISCUSSION_NUMBER

# This shows:
# - Original question with full context
# - All existing comments and replies
# - Comment IDs for threading responses
```

**Post Your Answer:**
```bash
# Reply to the main discussion
gh disc-reply owner repo DISCUSSION_NUMBER ROOT_COMMENT_ID "Your helpful response"

# Reply to a specific comment for clarification
gh disc-reply owner repo DISCUSSION_NUMBER SPECIFIC_COMMENT_ID "Follow-up clarification"
```

**Workflow Example:**
1. `gh disc-categories rayners fvtt-seasons-and-stars` - See available categories
2. `gh disc-category-discussions rayners fvtt-seasons-and-stars DIC_kwDOH... unanswered` - Find unanswered Q&A
